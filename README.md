# Twitter Clone (Fullstack)

### Description

This is a Twitter clone following an MVC pattern. It is a responsive website that has basic functionality such as authentication, CRUD database operations, etc. It is by no means a fully fledged clone of Twitter (missing likes, comments, re-tweets, etc) but rather a small representation of the website's funcitonality. The following describes its functionality so far:

-   to create, read, update and delete tweets (includes the possibility to attach images/gifs)
-   to create users (authenticates them) and allows for the updating of their profile pictures
-   to protect routes from visitors
-   to follow/unfollow a given user
-   to search a given user
